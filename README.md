Mindful
====

Do you ever feel overwhelmed, but can't figure out exactly why? If you do, then we're here to help!

Mindful is a web application to help minimalists generate insights on their mental health.

Mindful helps you track:
- Your sleep and wake times
- Supplements and medications you have taken
- Activities you did during the day
- How you felt during those activities

You could see an overview of your days on a single screen and discover which activities have helped you and which have hurt you.
